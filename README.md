# Topic 5: Capstone - Journal API

Welcome to your Python capstone project! You'll be working with a **FastAPI + PostgreSQL** application that helps people track their daily learning journey. This will prepare you for deploying to the cloud in the next phase.

By the end of this capstone, your API should be working locally and ready for cloud deployment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- VS Code with the Dev Containers extension

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button
1. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/journal-starter.git
   ```

1. Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd journal-starter
   ```

1. **Open in VS Code**:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### 2. Configure Your Environment (.env)

Environment variables live in a `.env` file (which is **git-ignored** so you don't accidentally commit secrets). This repo ships with a template named `.env-sample`.

1. Copy the sample file to create your real `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env-sample .env
   ```

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install the Dev Containers extension** in VS Code (if not already installed)
2. **Reopen in container**: When VS Code detects the `.devcontainer` folder, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Or use Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`): `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
3. **Wait for setup**: The API container will automatically install Python, dependencies, and configure your environment.
   The PostgreSQL Database container will also automatically be created.

### 4. Verify the PostgreSQL Database Is Running

In a terminal outside of VS Code, run:

   ```bash
      docker ps
   ```

You should see the postgres service running.

### 5. Run the API

Make sure you are in the root of your project in the terminal:

   ```bash
     ./start.sh
   ```

### 6. Test Everything Works! 🎉

1. **Visit the API docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
1. **Create your first entry** In the Docs UI Use the POST `/entries` endpoint to create a new journal entry.
1. **View your entries** using the GET `/entries` endpoint to see what you've created!

**🎯 Once you can create and see entries, you're ready to start implementing the missing endpoints!**

## Your Learning Goals

Complete a Journal API that allows users to:

- ✅ **Store journal entries** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Retrieve all journal entries** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Retrieve single journal entry** (you need to implement)  - **Implemented**
- ✅ **Delete specific journal entries** (you need to implement) - **Implemented**
- ✅ **Update journal entries** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Delete all entries** (already implemented)
- ❌ **Setup logging** (you need to implement)

## 🎯 Development Tasks (Your Work!)

You'll use **feature branches** and **Pull Requests (PRs)** for each task. Complete these tasks in your forked repository using feature branches.

### 1. API Implementation (Required)

#### Task 1a: GET Single Entry Endpoint

- Branch: `feature/get-single-entry`
- [ ] Implement **GET /entries/{entry_id}** in `api/routers/journal_router.py`

#### Task 1b: DELETE Single Entry Endpoint

- Branch: `feature/delete-entry`
- [ ] Implement **DELETE /entries/{entry_id}** in `api/routers/journal_router.py`

### 2. Logging Setup (Required)

- Branch: `feature/logging-setup`
- [ ] Configure logging in `api/main.py`

### 3. Data Model Improvements (Optional)

- Branch: `feature/data-model-improvements`  
- [ ] Add validators to `api/models/entry.py`

### 4. Cloud CLI Setup (Required for Deployment)

- Branch: `feature/cloud-cli-setup`
- [ ] Uncomment one CLI tool in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

## 📊 Data Schema

Each journal entry follows this structure:

| Field       | Type      | Description                                | Validation                   |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| id          | string    | Unique identifier (UUID)                   | Auto-generated               |
| work        | string    | What did you work on today?                | Required, max 256 characters |
| struggle    | string    | What's one thing you struggled with today? | Required, max 256 characters |
| intention   | string    | What will you study/work on tomorrow?      | Required, max 256 characters |
| created_at  | datetime  | When entry was created                     | Auto-generated UTC           |
| updated_at  | datetime  | When entry was last updated                | Auto-updated UTC             |

## 🗄️ Explore Your Database (Optional)

Want to see your data directly in the database? You can connect to PostgreSQL using VS Code's PostgreSQL extension:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Extension

1. **Install the PostgreSQL extension** in VS Code (search for "PostgreSQL" by Chris Kolkman)
2. **Restart VS Code** after installation

### 2. Connect to Your Database

1. **Open the PostgreSQL extension** (click the PostgreSQL icon in the sidebar)
2. **Click "Add Connection"** or the "+" button
3. **Enter these connection details**:
   - **Host name**: `postgres`
   - **User name**: `postgres`
   - **Password**: `postgres`
   - **Port**: `5432`
   - **Conection Type**: `Standard/No SSL`
   - **Database**: `career_journal`
   - **Display name**: `Journal Starter DB` (or any name you prefer)

### 3. Explore Your Data

1. **Expand your connection** in the PostgreSQL panel
2. **Left-click on "Journal Starter DB" to expand**
3. **Right-click on "career_journal"**
4. **Select "New Query"**
5. **Type this query** to see all your entries:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM entries;
   ```

6. **Run the query** to see all your journal data! (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter OR use the PostgreSQL command pallete: Run Query)

You can now explore the database structure, see exactly how your data is stored, and run custom queries to understand PostgreSQL better.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If the API won't start:**

- Make sure the PostgreSQL container is running: `docker ps`
- Check the container logs: `docker logs your-postgres-container-name`
- Restart the database: `docker restart your-postgres-container-name`

**If you can't connect to the database:**

- Verify the `.env` file exists and has the correct DATABASE_URL
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Try restarting the dev container: `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`

**If the dev container won't open:**

- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Install the "Dev Containers" extension in VS Code
- Try: `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`
