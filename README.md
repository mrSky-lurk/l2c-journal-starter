# Topic 5: Capstone - Journal API

Welcome to your Python capstone project! You'll be working with a **FastAPI + PostgreSQL** application that helps people track their daily learning journey. This will prepare you for deploying to the cloud in the next phase.

By the end of this capstone, your API should be working locally and ready for cloud deployment.

## �🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- VS Code with the Dev Containers extension

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button
1. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/journal-starter.git
   ```

1. Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd journal-starter
   ```

1. **Open in VS Code**:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### 2. Configure Your Environment (.env)

Environment variables live in a `.env` file (which is **git-ignored** so you don't accidentally commit secrets). This repo ships with a template named `.env-sample`.

1. Copy the sample file to create your real `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env-sample .env
   ```

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install the Dev Containers extension** in VS Code (if not already installed)
2. **Reopen in container**: When VS Code detects the `.devcontainer` folder, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Or use Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`): `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
3. **Wait for setup**: The API container will automatically install Python, dependencies, and configure your environment.
   The PostgreSQL Database container will also automatically be created.

### 4. Verify the PostgreSQL Database Is Running

In a terminal outside of VS Code, run:

```bash
   docker ps
```

You should see the postgres service running.

### 5. Run the API

Make sure you are in the root of your project in the terminal:

```bash
   ./start.sh
```

### 6. Test Everything Works! 🎉

1. **Visit the API docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
1. **Create your first entry** In the Docs UI Use the POST `/entries` endpoint to create a new journal entry.
1. **View your entries** using the GET `/entries` endpoint to see what you've created!

**🎯 Once you can create and see entries, you're ready to start implementing the missing endpoints!**

## 🗄️ Explore Your Database (Optional)

Want to see your data directly in the database? You can connect to PostgreSQL using VS Code's PostgreSQL extension:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Extension

1. **Install the PostgreSQL extension** in VS Code (search for "PostgreSQL" by Chris Kolkman)
2. **Restart VS Code** after installation

### 2. Connect to Your Database

1. **Open the PostgreSQL extension** (click the PostgreSQL icon in the sidebar)
2. **Click "Add Connection"** or the "+" button
3. **Enter these connection details**:
   - **Host name**: `postgres`
   - **User name**: `postgres`
   - **Password**: `postgres`
   - **Port**: `5432`
   - **Conection Type**: `Standard/No SSL`
   - **Database**: `career_journal`
   - **Display name**: `Journal Starter DB` (or any name you prefer)

### 3. Explore Your Data

1. **Expand your connection** in the PostgreSQL panel
2. **Left-click on "Journal Starter DB" to expand**
3. **Right-click on "career_journal"**
4. **Select "New Query"**
5. **Type this query** to see all your entries:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM entries;
   ```

6. **Run the query** to see all your journal data! (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter OR use the PostgreSQL command pallete: Run Query)

You can now explore the database structure, see exactly how your data is stored, and run custom queries to understand PostgreSQL better.

## Project Structure

This project uses a clean FastAPI architecture with PostgreSQL:

```txt
api/
├── main.py                    # FastAPI app entry point
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies  
├── models/
│   └── entry.py              # Pydantic data models
├── repositories/
│   ├── interface_repository.py    # Database interface
│   └── postgres_repository.py     # PostgreSQL implementation
├── routers/
│   └── journal_router.py     # API endpoints (YOUR MAIN WORK HERE)
└── services/
    └── entry_service.py      # Business logic layer
```

## 🌳 Git Workflow & Best Practices

You'll use **feature branches** and **Pull Requests (PRs)** for each task.

### Your Git Workflow

Create a **feature branch** for each task:

```bash
# 1. Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/get-single-entry

# 3. Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement GET /entries/{id} endpoint"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/get-single-entry
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/get-single-entry` - GET single entry endpoint
- `feature/delete-entry` - DELETE entry endpoint  
- `feature/logging-setup` - Logging implementation
- `feature/cloud-cli-setup` - Cloud CLI configuration

## Your Learning Goals

Complete a Journal API that allows users to:

- ✅ **Store journal entries** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Retrieve all journal entries** (already implemented)
- ❌ **Retrieve single journal entry** (you need to implement)  
- ❌ **Delete specific journal entries** (you need to implement)
- ✅ **Update journal entries** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Delete all entries** (already implemented)
- ❌ **Setup logging** (you need to implement)

## 🎯 Development Tasks (Your Work!)

Complete each task using the **feature branch workflow**. This mirrors real-world development practices!

### 1. API Implementation (Required)

#### Task 1a: GET Single Entry Endpoint

**Branch: `feature/get-single-entry`**

1. **Create your feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/get-single-entry
   ```

2. **Implement the endpoint** in `api/routers/journal_router.py`:
   - [ ] **GET /entries/{entry_id}** - Get single entry by ID

3. **Test your implementation**:
   - Use the `/docs` page to test your endpoint
   - Try valid and invalid entry IDs

4. **Commit and push**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement GET /entries/{id} endpoint

   - Add route handler for single entry retrieval
   - Include proper error handling for non-existent entries
   - Add response model validation"
   
   git push origin feature/get-single-entry
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Use this PR template:

   ```markdown
   ## 📝 Description
   Implements GET /entries/{entry_id} endpoint for retrieving single journal entries.

   ## ✅ Testing Done
   - [x] Tested with valid entry ID via /docs
   - [x] Tested with invalid entry ID (returns 404)
   - [x] Verified response matches Entry model schema

   ## 📸 Screenshots
   (Add screenshot of successful test from /docs page)
   ```

#### Task 1b: DELETE Single Entry Endpoint

**Branch: `feature/delete-entry`**

1. **Create your feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main  # Get any merged changes
   git checkout -b feature/delete-entry
   ```

2. **Implement the endpoint**:
   - [ ] **DELETE /entries/{entry_id}** - Delete specific entry

3. **Follow the same commit, push, and PR process** as above

### Getting Your PR Reviewed

**Do a Self-Review**
Before merging your PR, do a thorough **self-review**:

1. **Check the diff** - Does every change make sense?
2. **Test thoroughly** - Does the feature work as expected?
3. **Read your code** - Is it clear and well-commented?
4. **Run the app** - Does everything still work?
5. **Consider edge cases** - What could go wrong?

### Merging Your PR

Once you've completed your self-review:

1. **Address any issues** - Fix anything you found during review
2. **Test one more time** - Make sure everything works
3. **Merge when ready** - Use "Squash and merge" for clean history
4. **Delete the branch** - Keep your repository clean

```bash
# After merging, clean up locally
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-branch-name
```
